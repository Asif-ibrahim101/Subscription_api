/**
 * SUBSCRIPTION ROUTES (routes/subscription.routes.js)
 * 
 * This file defines all subscription-related routes for the subscription tracker application.
 * These routes handle subscription management including creating, reading, updating,
 * deleting subscriptions, and specialized operations like cancellation and renewal tracking.
 * 
 * Route Structure:
 * - All routes are prefixed with '/api/v1/subscriptions' (defined in app.js)
 * - Uses RESTful conventions with additional specialized endpoints
 * - Most routes will require authentication (to be implemented)
